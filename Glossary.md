ðŸ”¹ Networking Fundamentals
IP Address â€“ A unique identifier for a device on a network.

Subnetting â€“ Dividing an IP network into smaller sub-networks.

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) â€“ IP address allocation method to improve routing efficiency.

NAT (Network Address Translation) â€“ Translates private IP addresses to public IPs.

DNS (Domain Name System) â€“ Resolves human-readable names to IP addresses.

Load Balancer â€“ Distributes traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and scalability.

L4/L7 â€“ Refers to OSI layers 4 (Transport) and 7 (Application) for load balancing and policy enforcement.

ðŸ”¹ Application Networking
Service Mesh â€“ A dedicated infrastructure layer (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) for managing service-to-service communication.

Ingress Controller â€“ Manages external access to services in Kubernetes.

API Gateway â€“ Manages, authenticates, and routes API traffic (e.g., Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway).

Reverse Proxy â€“ Forwards requests from clients to backend servers (e.g., NGINX, Envoy).

East-West Traffic â€“ Internal service-to-service communication.

North-South Traffic â€“ External client-to-service communication.

TLS Termination â€“ Decryption of incoming TLS traffic at a proxy/load balancer.

ðŸ”¹ Security & Policies
Zero Trust â€“ A security model that assumes no implicit trust, verifying every access attempt.

mTLS (Mutual TLS) â€“ Both client and server authenticate each other using TLS certificates.

WAF (Web Application Firewall) â€“ Protects web applications from common threats like SQL injection.

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) â€“ Limits access based on user roles.

Network Policies â€“ Define how groups of pods/services are allowed to communicate.

ðŸ”¹ Cloud & Hybrid Networking
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) â€“ Isolated network environment in public cloud providers.

Transit Gateway â€“ Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-prem networks (e.g., AWS Transit Gateway).

Service Discovery â€“ Dynamically locates services in a distributed system.

Cloud Load Balancer â€“ Managed load balancing service provided by cloud vendors (e.g., AWS ALB, Azure Load Balancer).

Peering â€“ Direct network connection between two cloud networks or VPCs.

ðŸ”¹ Kubernetes & Microservices
Kube-Proxy â€“ Maintains network rules for pod communication in Kubernetes.

ClusterIP / NodePort / LoadBalancer â€“ Kubernetes service types for exposing applications.

Network Overlay â€“ Abstracts network connectivity between containers across hosts.

CNI (Container Network Interface) â€“ Plugins that configure network interfaces in containers (e.g., Calico, Cilium).

ðŸ”¹ Observability & Monitoring
Telemetry â€“ Collection of metrics, logs, and traces.

Distributed Tracing â€“ Tracks a request across services to diagnose performance issues.

Latency / Throughput / Errors / Saturation (L.T.E.S.) â€“ Key metrics in application performance monitoring.

Prometheus / Grafana â€“ Common tools for metrics collection and visualization.

OpenTelemetry â€“ Open standard for observability instrumentation.

Anypoint CLI

What it is / Description

Anypoint CLI is a command-line interface and scripting tool for interacting with the Anypoint Platform. It provides a way to manage various aspects of the platform—including APIs, applications, and assets—without using the graphical user interface. Anypoint CLI is particularly useful for automation and scripting tasks.

Why it's used / Use Case

Developers and administrators use Anypoint CLI to:

Automate Deployment: Script the deployment of Mule applications and APIs to different environments like CloudHub or Runtime Fabric, ensuring a consistent and repeatable process.

Enhance CI/CD Workflows: Integrate platform tasks into continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines, allowing for automated testing and deployment.

Manage Platform Resources: Perform administrative tasks, such as managing users, business groups, environments, and firewall rules, from the command line.

Interact with Anypoint Exchange: Automate the publishing and management of API specifications and other reusable assets in Anypoint Exchange.

Script Repetitive Tasks: Execute routine operations on the platform in a batch or script, which saves time and reduces the chance of manual error.
